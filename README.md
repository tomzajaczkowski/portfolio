## About me

My name is Tomasz Zajączkowski. I graduated Mechanical Engineering at Wroclaw University of Technology. I've started to interest software testing for 6 months and then I began to build my technical background to be a professional software tester soon. During my curent job I have a lots of opportunities to find various bugs in software I working with. Please see below my examples. My goal is to be a proffesional automated software tester but I'm aware of path I have to follow and I don't want to miss being manual software tester on the beggining of my it career.

## Based on my experience so far

* I have experience working with advanced engineering Siemens software  
* I've provided about 50 training courses for the customers who are end users of software we implement into the engineering market. Typical training session takes 3 days for 		approximately 4 people. To sum up it's about 200 end users participate in my courses. During these training session there always were some complains about software which I had to force with. That kind of situations trained me well to be communicative person. I was often attacked by users but everytime I defend my point of view successfuly.
*  As helpdesk support engineer I had to made steps to reproduce the issue reported by end users. Usually I found another issue during making these steps. My task was to report the issue to global support includes both video and screens documentation. There were plenty of times that I got the answer "working as designed" or "cannot reproduce the issue". My goal was to convince global support engineer that problem really exists. I had a chance to report IR (incident report), PR (problem report) and even ER (enhancement request). 
* I know CNC programming what is also useful for analytical way of thinking
* I was also responsible for preparing the postprocessors for CAM software. For postprocessors we use TCL, simple, compiled scripting language. I'm rookie programmer but I find it interesting for me and I want to work on my programming skills. 
* During preparing postprocessors I had to work with lots of variables from software usage library. Very often I had to use review tool debugger and analyze log file to find the solution for the problem. Then I had to do retest and regression test.
* The product that customers get from company is configuration package. We prepare that configuration based on batch file.
