## About me

My name is Tomasz Zajączkowski. I graduated Mechanical Engineering at Wroclaw University of Technology. I've started to interest software testing for 6 months and then I began to build my technical background to be a professional software tester soon. During my current job I have a lots of opportunities to find various bugs in software I work with. Please see below my examples. My goal is to be a proffesional automated software tester but I'm aware of path I have to follow and I don't want to miss being manual software tester prior. I like to speak English. I'm focused on pronounciation. I have regular meetings with native speaker from USA. 

## Facts based on my experience so far

* I have experience working with advanced engineering Siemens PLM software.  
* I've provided about 72 training courses for the customers who are end users of software we implement into the market. Typical training session takes 3 days for 		approximately 4 people. To sum up it's about 200 end users participate in my courses. During these training sessions there were always some complains about software which I had to force with. That kind of situations trained me well to be communicative person. I was often attacked by users but everytime I defended my point of view successfuly.
*  As helpdesk support engineer I had to made steps to reproduce the issue reported by end users. Usually I found another issue during making these steps on my own. My task was to report the issue to global support includes both video and screens documentation. There were plenty of times that I got the answer "working as designed" or "cannot reproduce the issue". My goal was to convince global support engineer that problem really exists. I had a chance to report IR (incident report), PR (problem report) and even ER (enhancement request).
* I have provided about 32 presales presentation of our product what lead our Sales representative to have a deal with the prospect. Three of them were provided in English for foreign customers. 
* I was also responsible for preparing the postprocessors for CAM software. For making the postprocessors we use TCL, simple, compiled scripting language. I'm rookie programmer but I find it interesting for me and I want to work on my programming skills to be a automated tester in the future. 
* During preparing postprocessors I had to work with lots of variables from software usage library. Very often I had to use review tool debugger and analyze log file to find the solution for the problem. Then I had to do retest and regression test.
* The product that customers get from company is configuration package. We prepare that configuration based on batch file.
* I know CNC programming what is also useful for analytical way of thinking.
